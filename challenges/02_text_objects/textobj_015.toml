detailed_hint = "Backtick-delimited text is common in markdown and template literals. ci` changes the content between a pair of backticks, just as ci\" works for double quotes. Jump to a backtick with f` and then ci` to enter insert mode with the inner text removed. Each backtick pair is independent, so you target each one individually. Use 0 to return to the start of the line before searching forward."
