The key strategy is interleaving with dot repeat: change timeout with jf3cw60<Esc>, jump 5j0f3 and dot-repeat. Navigate 4k0 back to retries, change with f3r5, jump 5j and dot-repeat (column preservation lands cursor on the matching '3'). Continue to secure with j0fFcwTrue<Esc>, then 5k0fF and dot-repeat. Each pair of edits costs only a few extra keystrokes for the second instance thanks to the dot command."
