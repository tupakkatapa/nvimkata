Now use g;g; (two changelist jumps) to return to line 1 at the exact column where you changed X to A. The first g; confirms the current changelist position, the second moves to the previous entry. Since the cursor lands precisely on 'A', use aB to append 'B', making it 'AB'. The changelist remembers exact column positions of every edit, making g; invaluable in large files."
