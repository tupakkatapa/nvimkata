detailed_hint = "First qaq clears register a. Then qa starts recording: I<li><Esc> inserts the opening tag, A</li><Esc> appends the closing tag, j moves down, @a calls itself (no-op during recording since a is empty), q stops. Now @a plays the full macro — it wraps the line, moves down, and calls @a again recursively. The recursion terminates when j fails on the last line. This pattern processes any number of lines without needing to count them."
