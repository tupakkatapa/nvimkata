Move to the first data line with j. Record qd: @a@b@c applies all three substitutions to the current line, j moves down. Stop with q. Replay with 2@d for the remaining lines. The key insight: any ex command stored in a register (including the newline) can be executed with @ — turning text in your buffer into executable commands."
