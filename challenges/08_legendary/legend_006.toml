detailed_hint = ":%s/\\d\\+/\\=submatch(0)*2/<Enter> finds every number (\\d\\+) and replaces it with submatch(0)*2 -- the matched number doubled. The \\= prefix in the replacement tells vim to evaluate a vimscript expression instead of using a literal string. Then :%s/size/area/<Enter> renames the prefix. Finally :%s/ = /: /<Enter> converts from assignment to YAML-style colon syntax."
