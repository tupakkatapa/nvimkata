detailed_hint = "Phase 1 - Harvest into named registers: \"ayi\" yanks 'svc-auth-proxy' into reg a. j\"byi\" yanks 'svc-data-router' into reg b. j\"cyi\" yanks 'svc-edge-cache' into reg c. Phase 2 - Cross-plant the circular rotation (a->c, b->a, c->b): 3j moves past blank and header to route_a line. ci\"<C-r>b<Esc> plants svc-data-router. j0ci\"<C-r>c<Esc> plants svc-edge-cache (0 resets cursor since the longer replacement text pushes cursor past the quotes on the shorter next line). j0ci\"<C-r>a<Esc> plants svc-auth-proxy. Phase 3 - Batch rename: :%s/TODO/DONE<Enter> updates all markers. The named registers are essential because ci\" clobbers the default register, so without \"a/\"b/\"c the values would be lost during each replacement."
