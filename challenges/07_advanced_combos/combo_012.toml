detailed_hint = ":g/^/m0<Enter> is a classic vim trick — the global command matches every line (^ matches start) and moves each one to line 0. Because :g processes top-to-bottom, each line overtakes the previous, reversing the order. Then <C-v>3j$A;<Esc> selects all 4 lines in block mode, $ extends to end of each line, A enters append mode, and ; adds the semicolon to every line."
