Vjj:sort<Enter> selects lines 2-4 and sorts them alphabetically (DELTA, ECHO, FOXTROT). gvgu reselects lines 2-4 and lowercases them. :%s/val/= 42;<Enter> replaces 'val' with '= 42;' on every matching line, adding both the assignment operator and semicolon. Finally 8GdG jumps to line 8 and deletes everything from there to the end of the file. This gauntlet combines line case operators, visual sort with reselection, global substitution, and ranged deletion."
