Practice efficient editing in Neovim. A TUI drops you into real Neovim, with your own config, and counts every keystroke as you edit a target buffer. Over 200 challenges from basic motions to legendary combos, with categories that unlock as you progress. Each challenge has a par keystroke count and is graded A through F based on how close you get.

```bash
nix run github:tupakkatapa/nvimkata
